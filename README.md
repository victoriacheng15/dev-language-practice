# Dev Language Practice

This repository is my personal playground for learning and practicing various programming languages. Each language has its own directory, which contains my notes, exercises, and small projects as I explore different concepts and paradigms.

Currently, the repository includes:

-   **Go**: My journey learning the Go programming language.
    -   [Go README](go/README.md)

-   **Ruby**: My exploration of Ruby, focusing on building command-line interface (CLI) tools.
    -   [Ruby README](ruby/README.md)

Feel free to browse the individual language folders to see my progress and projects.
